# `Docker run` parameters

This directory contains the `.XML`-files that unRAID creates when installing an application (docker container) from the store. The parameters and values are the same as the ones used in a `docker run` command, thus they can be used by non-unRAID-users just fine.

The [`get_new`](/__start-parameters/get_new)-script is only used for me to copy the new files from their location on the unRAID-server in `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user`.
